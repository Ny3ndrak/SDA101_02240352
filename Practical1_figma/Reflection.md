This  group project was based on replicating the website indeed using figma. Through this project, i got close with my colleagues and multiple team members can work on the design simultaneously, making it easier to share ideas and feedback in real-time.
Figma has a vast community and plenty of resources like templates, plugins, and tutorials that made learning and staying updated easier.
